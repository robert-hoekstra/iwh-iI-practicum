# CMS for Developers II: Best Practices Practicum

This repository is for the "CMS for Developers II: Best Practices" practicum, a crucial part of achieving the certification. This practicum builds upon the original CMS for Developers practicum by focusing on creating an optimized theme and web page using HubSpot's CMS, incorporating best practices for web accessibility, performance, SEO, and more.

## Important Note
This practicum is manually graded. Please allow up to seven business days for grading. Certification will only be awarded after successful evaluation. Additionally, an exam with a passing grade of at least 75% is required for full certification.

## Practicum Overview
This practicum tests your ability to apply best practices in:
- Web accessibility
- Website performance
- Creating optimized themes, sections, and modules in the CMS
- SEO

An instructional video is available to outline expectations. The estimated completion time is 2-5 hours, depending on your experience level.

## Objective
Create an optimized theme and web page that adheres to the following requirements:

### Theme Folder Structure
Your theme should include the following structure:
- **Theme Folder**
  - **CSS Folder**
    - `main.css` (includes other CSS files)
    - At least one additional CSS file (e.g., `_layout.css`)
  - **Image and Text Section**
  - **Team Members Section**
  - `base.html` file
  - One template file extending the base template (containing the two sections)
  - **Partials Folder**
    - Header and footer partials with options for background color
  - **Modules Folder**
    - A custom team module fulfilling the outlined requirements
  - **Images Folder**
    - `sections-preview` folder containing screenshots for the two reusable sections
  - **Sections Folder**
    - Two reusable section templates
  - **Templates Folder**
    - **Layouts Folder**
  - `fields.json` file containing at least three colors that inherit from the account’s brand settings
  - `theme.json` file

## Directions
1. Review all requirements on this page.
2. Optimize your theme using your original CMS for Developers practicum as a starting point. Adjust your theme to match the outlined structure.
3. Use the page editor to create a page from your template and ensure it meets the performance, accessibility, and SEO requirements.
4. Copy the shareable link to this page and submit it through the practicum form.

### Submission Guidelines
- **Do Not** use the upload option. Share a link to a live page.
- **Do Not** submit a page preview or in-app page (like the page editor or design manager).
- **Do Not** submit previously-built themes or websites. Ensure your submission meets the specific requirements outlined.

### Tips
- Use your original CMS for Developers practicum as a starting point.
- Consider using a sandbox CMS account.
- Utilize HubSpot themes and boilerplates to understand techniques and syntax.
- The `_layout.css` file from the boilerplate can help optimize the drag-and-drop area.
- Build this locally or in the Design Tools, selecting "Blank Theme" as your starting point if using the latter.

## Requirements
### General
- All work must be original. The grading process will include a revision history check.
- Adapt the boilerplate significantly if used; simple implementations will not pass.
- **Accessibility:** 
  - Pass the Axe DevTools browser extension audit and Lighthouse accessibility audit with a score of 100.
  - Implement landmarks, heading hierarchy, color contrast, and alt text for images.
  - Include a skip to content link and ensure logical tab order and appropriate zoom reflow.
- **Performance:**
  - Achieve a Lighthouse performance score of at least 90 on both desktop and mobile.
  - Optimize images within your team module using `resize_image_url`, include height and width attributes, and lazy-load images by default.
- **Theme, Sections, and Modules:**
  - Include at least one page template extending a `base.html` template.
  - Include `main.css` and another CSS file (`_layout.css`) using the `include` tag.
  - `fields.json` should contain at least three theme colors inheriting from the account’s brand settings.
  - Create two reusable section templates and provide screenshots for visual reference in the page editor.
  - Update your team module to include at least one style field, using `require_css`, `scope_css`, and a generated CSS property.
- **SEO:**
  - Pass Lighthouse SEO audits on both desktop and mobile.
  - Ensure the page is mobile-friendly and fully responsive.
  - Include a valid and appropriate title and meta description.

## Final Submission
Upon completion, submit the live page link using the practicum submission form. Be mindful of the outlined requirements to ensure a passing grade. If there are any questions or clarifications needed, feel free to reach out.
